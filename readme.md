🟣 Python API Fetch & Json to CSV, CSV to Excel 
--
Hello friends, I have developed a small Python script as per the requirement.
This script takes data from any API and converts it from JSON format to CSV format.
It's a small script, but I believe it will get the job done. <br> <br> 📜 Note: It is completely open source, and you can make additional improvements to it. ;)

🚀 Current Features:
--
    * Conversion of JSON files to CSV format
    * Handling headers for cookie operations
    * Fetching data within a specified time range
    * Setting the refresh interval for data in milliseconds (default: 2 hours or 7200 ms)

🛠️ Upcoming Features:
--
    * Conversion to Excel format
    * User interface and frontend design (using Django)
    * Transformation into a microservice architecture
    * Creating an internal API architecture for external system integration
    * Some Code Improvements

⚠️ Required Libraries to Run:

    Requests: 
    "pip install requests"

    Pandas:
    "pip install pandas"

    Json:
